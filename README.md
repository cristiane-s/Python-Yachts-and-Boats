# Python-Yachts-and-Boats

Data Analysis project conducted in Python for Career Foundry Data Analytics Program.
As a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website, I hereby present the insights from a data set about the popularity of yachts and boats.


# Objective

The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends. 

Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of the data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better marketing strategies.

# Data
The data is publicly available open-source data, available on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikbhandary2/boat-sales?resource=download).

# Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:

pandas - for data analysis
seaborn - for data visualization


# Executing the code
The code is available as Jupyter notebooks, available under /scripts/

To launch the notebook, open the terminal and run the command:

- importing data: jupyter notebook importData.ipynb

- generate CrossTabs: jupyter notebook createCrossTabs.ipynb

# Tableau storyboard

The Tableau Storyboard is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cristiane.s./viz/CareerFoundry-Task6_7-PopularityofYachtsandBoats/ResultsRecommendations).
